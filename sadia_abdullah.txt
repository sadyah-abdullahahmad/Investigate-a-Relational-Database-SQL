 /* Question 1:*/

We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children
Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.
Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number
of times it has been rented out.

 /* Query 1 */


SELECT t1.title, t1.name, COUNT(Rental)
FROM
    (SELECT f.title ,c.name , r.rental_id AS Rental
     FROM category AS c
     JOIN film_category fc ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
     JOIN film f ON fc.film_id = f.film_id
     JOIN inventory i ON f.film_id= i.film_id
     JOIN rental r ON i.inventory_id= r.inventory_id
WHERE c.name IN ('Animation','Classics','Comedy','Family','Music','Children')) t1
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 2



 /* Question 2:*/


we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the duration that all movies are rented for
 Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter)
 based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories? Make sure to also indicate
 the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.

 /* Query 2 */


SELECT r1.title , r1.name,
       r1.rental_duration ,
       NTILE (4) OVER (ORDER BY r1.rental_duration ) AS Standard_Qurtiles
FROM
     (SELECT f.title , c.name ,f.rental_duration
      FROM category AS c
      JOIN film_category AS fc
	  ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
      JOIN film  AS f
	  ON fc.film_id = f.film_id
WHERE c.name IN ('Animation','Classics','Comedy','Family', 'Music','Children'))r1;



 /* Question 3:*/

provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies
within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category. The resulting table should have three columns:
. Category
. Rental length category
. Count


 /* Query 3 */


SELECT  w1.name, standard_qurtiles, COUNT(w1.standard_qurtiles)
FROM
      (SELECT f.title , c.name, f.rental_duration ,
      NTILE (4) OVER (ORDER BY f.rental_duration ) AS Standard_Qurtiles
      FROM category  AS c
      JOIN film_category AS fc
      ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
      JOIN film AS f
      ON fc.film_id = f.film_id
WHERE c.name in ('Animation','Classics','Comedy','Family', 'Music','Children'))w1
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1

 /* Question 4:*/

We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years
we have data for. Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental
orders each store has fulfilled for that month. Your table should include a column for each of the following: year, month,
store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that month.

 /* Query 4 */


SELECT  DATE_PART ('month', rental_date )  AS Rental_month,
        DATE_PART ('year', rental_date )  AS Rental_year,
        s2.Store_ID,
        COUNT (*) AS Count_Rentals
  FROM rental AS r
  JOIN staff AS s1
  ON s1.staff_id=r.staff_id
  JOIN store AS s2
  ON s1.store_id=s2.store_id
group by 1,2,3
ORDER BY 1,2
